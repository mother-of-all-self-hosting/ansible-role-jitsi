# This tasks file starts and stops (if state before was stopped) a Prosody container during setup to run commands,
# that require a running Prosody container.
# The task is called in ../setup_jitsi_prosody_install.yml.
#
# Important: The task is called conditionally, as to only start if really needed.
# So if you add or change anything - remember to also change the 'when' in:  ../setup_jitsi_prosody_install.yml
